  - By default, app will be running at http://localhost:8080/
  
  ## Note about music:
  Most samples were provided in the ASCIT/donut-challenge repo. The drum samples are from [SampleSwap](http://sampleswap.org/about/)
  
  ## Note about project:
  Yeah, it doesn't look very nice. It's more of a proof of concept than a full blown webapp.
