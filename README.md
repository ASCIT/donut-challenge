# The Donut Challenge

## Compiling and running
````bash
npm i
export NODE_ENV=production
npm run build
npm run compile
server/start.js
````

## Usage instructions
1. Open a browser to `http://localhost:8000`
2. Add some dank beats using the plus button on the right
3. Zoom in or out using the buttons in the upper right so that you are viewing the tracks at an appropriate scale
4. Move the tracks earlier or later by clicking in the middle, moving the mouse, and clicking again when they are in the right place
5. Trim the tracks by clicking on the ends, moving the mouse, and clicking again
6. Rename a track by clicking on it
7. Editing operations can be cancelled by pressing `ESC`
8. Tracks can be deleted by clicking on the trash icons
9. When you are done editing, click on the `Copy to clipboard` icon to get text you can share. Other users can click on the `Paste from clipboard` button and supply your text to get a copy of your tracks.

You can add more music files to `public/music` if you want the app to support more tracks.

## Goal
- Design a fun, interactive experience that incorporates all the sounds in the ```music/``` folder.
- Just remember to respect the Honor Code, and not just copy and paste code.

## Requirements
- Use every sound in the ```music/``` folder.
- Engage the user with an exciting web experience (or mobile if you have experience with that)
- You may use a modern Javascript framework like React.js, or have clean vanilla JS.
- Be able to explain every design choice from module layout to code organization.
- If you're not comfortable with web development, feel free to use C++, Java, Python, or whatever you're comfortable with.

## Bonus points
- Building a backend with Python Flask specifically
- Great Design / UI / UX
- Having clean modular code that shows an understanding of closures and functional programming

## Submission
- Fork this repo, and send a merge request only when you're ready for us to take a look!
- You have two weeks to build an amazing product. Good luck!

## Need Inspiration?
- Try making a jukebox with the different soundtracks!

## Music notes
- Feel free to add or change music as long as you have at least 4 soundtracks and 3 sound effects.
  - Delete any unused music files.
- Soundtracks were taken from http://www.indiegamemusic.com/
  - Please check that site for details on purchasing licenses to use the music.
  - I tried to name the file after its composed name if it has an owner.
- Sound effects were taken from http://www.flashkit.com/soundfx/
  - I believe the ones I chose were Freeware, but it's always good to check before using in a production setting!
