<h1>The Donut Frontend Challenge</h1>

<h2>Goal</h2>
- Design a fun, interactive experience that incorporates all the sounds in the ```music/``` folder.
- A good frontend developer is an artist, so we're giving you full artistic license with every decision.
- Just remember to respect the Honor Code, and not just copy and paste code.

<h2>Requirements</h2>
- Use every sound in the ```music/``` folder.
- Engage the user with an exciting HTML5 experience.
- Use a modern Javascript framework just as React.js, or have clean vanilla JS.
- Be able to explain every design choice from module layout to HTML organization.

<h2>Bonus points</h2>
- Using React.js specifically (or prove that your framework is better)
- Having clean modular code that shows an understanding of closures and functional programming

<h2>Submission</h2>
- Fork this repo, and send a merge request only when you're ready for us to take a look!
- You have one week to build an amazing product. Good luck!

<h2>Need Inspiration?</h2>
- Try making a jukebox with the different soundtracks to get started!

<h2>Music notes</h2>
- Feel free to add or change music as long as you have at least 4 soundtracks and 3 sound effects.
  - Delete any unused music files.
- Soundtracks were taken from http://www.indiegamemusic.com/
  - Please check that site for details on purchasing licenses to use the music.
  - I tried to name the file after its composed name if it has an owner.
- Sound effects were taken from http://www.flashkit.com/soundfx/
  - I believe the ones I chose were Freeware, but it's always good to check before using in a production setting!
