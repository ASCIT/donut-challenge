# The Donut Challenge (Jenny's submission)
A fun HTML5 game of fishes that I made in the span of 3 days for the [ASCIT website](http://donut.caltech.edu) devteam application! Website at http://107.170.208.38/donut-challenge/

### How to play:
Use arrow keys to control your fish. Don't go outside of boundaries. Otherwise, basically just follow the directions.

### Notes:
- The background music is chosen from 2 music soundtracks at random whenever the music has been stopped and is played again.
- The speed becomes faster every time your fish eats a goldfish.
- See below for the details of the actual donut challenge.

#### Goal
- Design a fun, interactive experience that incorporates all the sounds in the ```music/``` folder.
- Just remember to respect the Honor Code, and not just copy and paste code.

#### Requirements
- Use every sound in the ```music/``` folder.
- Engage the user with an exciting web experience (or mobile if you have experience with that)
- You may use a modern Javascript framework like React.js, or have clean vanilla JS.
- Be able to explain every design choice from module layout to code organization.
- If you're not comfortable with web development, feel free to use C++, Java, Python, or whatever you're comfortable with.

#### Bonus points
- Building a backend with Python Flask specifically
- Great Design / UI / UX
- Having clean modular code that shows an understanding of closures and functional programming

#### Submission
- Fork this repo, and send a merge request only when you're ready for us to take a look!
- You have two weeks to build an amazing product. Good luck!

#### Need Inspiration?
- Try making a jukebox with the different soundtracks!

#### Music notes
- Feel free to add or change music as long as you have at least 4 soundtracks and 3 sound effects.
  - Delete any unused music files.
- Soundtracks were taken from http://www.indiegamemusic.com/
  - Please check that site for details on purchasing licenses to use the music.
  - I tried to name the file after its composed name if it has an owner.
- Sound effects were taken from http://www.flashkit.com/soundfx/
  - I believe the ones I chose were Freeware, but it's always good to check before using in a production setting!
