# The Donut Challenge

I made a cool little game using HTML canvas and javascript. I was planning on making a global leaderboard feature with backend, but I do not know Python Flask, only Node and some django, so I guess I'll postpone that for now.

How To Play:
============
The game is quite simple.

The player is a bird that is trying to survive an apocalyptic rain of fire.
To make things worse, there is an enemy who tries to shoot it down periodically

To control the bird, use the arrow keys. Beware of the effect of gravity!
The bird dies instantly when hit by a meteor, even a small one.
The bird loses 25% of its health every time it gets hit by a bullet
The bird can poop too! Simply press spacebar and a little white poop nugget will drop

The start page plays adventure_awaits
The main track for the actual game is fantasy_town
When the enemy is actively shooting, the music changes to fantasy_boss
Each time the enemy shoots out a bullet, the attack sound is played
If the player is hit by a bullet, the damaged sound is played
If the player survives the attack phase of the enemy, the cheer sound is played
When the player dies, the respectfully_resigned track is played


## Goal
- Design a fun, interactive experience that incorporates all the sounds in the ```music/``` folder.
- Just remember to respect the Honor Code, and not just copy and paste code.

## Requirements
- Use every sound in the ```music/``` folder.
- Engage the user with an exciting web experience (or mobile if you have experience with that)
- You may use a modern Javascript framework like React.js, or have clean vanilla JS.
- Be able to explain every design choice from module layout to code organization.
- If you're not comfortable with web development, feel free to use C++, Java, Python, or whatever you're comfortable with.

## Bonus points
- Building a backend with Python Flask specifically
- Great Design / UI / UX
- Having clean modular code that shows an understanding of closures and functional programming

## Submission
- Fork this repo, and send a merge request only when you're ready for us to take a look!
- You have two weeks to build an amazing product. Good luck!

## Need Inspiration?
- Try making a jukebox with the different soundtracks!

## Music notes
- Feel free to add or change music as long as you have at least 4 soundtracks and 3 sound effects.
  - Delete any unused music files.
- Soundtracks were taken from http://www.indiegamemusic.com/
  - Please check that site for details on purchasing licenses to use the music.
  - I tried to name the file after its composed name if it has an owner.
- Sound effects were taken from http://www.flashkit.com/soundfx/
  - I believe the ones I chose were Freeware, but it's always good to check before using in a production setting!
