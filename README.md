*Play a song and create your own beat to play along!*

Description
-----------

This project was completed as part of Caltechâ€™s ASCIT Donut frontend challenge. As a result, I was accepted into the ASCIT Donut Devteam.

This website allows you to play one of four songs and create your own beat to play along simply by clicking on boxes.

The frontend was developed using React.js.
