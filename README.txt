DJ is an interactive, creative experience that allows the user to create their
own music from the soundtracks.
Darker colors indicate that the music for that block is playing. Each block
plays a different track from the music folder. Each track plays on infinite
loop unless it's paused.

One of the soudtracks, cheer.mp3, does not loop on Google Chrome for some
reason. It works on Safari and Firefox. Load the HTML file in one of the other
browsers.
