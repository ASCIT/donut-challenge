Technical Debt Log:
	**0001: enemyDeadSound global
		Ideal design is to include the enemyDeadSound inside the enemy object.
		However, there was a bug where it would often not play if we were also trying
		to delete it. Added a global hacky work-around. 
		Status: Still around

	**0002: Sound object includes Music object.
		Ideal design is to have both derived from the same object.
		The current design was just a little hack to get the application put together in
		time. As JavaScript doesn't use typical OOP design patterns as far as I'm aware and
		I don't usually program anything but scripts in JS, this was my hacky inheritance.
		Status: Still around
